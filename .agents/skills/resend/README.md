# Resend Skills

A collection of skills for AI coding agents following the Agent Skills format. These skills enable AI agents to work with the [Resend](https://resend.com) email platform.

## Available Skills

### [`send-email`](./send-email)
Send emails using the Resend API — single or batch. Supports transactional emails, notifications, and bulk sending (up to 100 emails per batch). Includes best practices for idempotency keys, error handling, and retry logic.

### [`templates`](./templates)
Create, update, publish, and delete reusable email templates via the Resend API. Covers template lifecycle (draft → publish → send), variable syntax (`{{{VAR}}}`), variable constraints, reserved names, and cursor-based pagination for listing templates.

### [`resend-inbound`](./resend-inbound)
Receive emails with Resend. Covers MX record setup, processing `email.received` webhooks, retrieving attachments, and forwarding received emails.

### [`agent-email-inbox`](./agent-email-inbox)
Set up a secure email inbox for AI agents or any system where untrusted email content triggers actions. Includes security levels, trusted sender allowlists, and content safety filtering.
